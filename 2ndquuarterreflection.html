      As the 2nd quarter ends, I feel proud about everything that I learned
      from ICT, especially regarding CSS. At first, I struggled to understand
      how styles worked and how to make the websites look better. The more we 
      practiced, though, it became fun and rewarding. I enjoyed discovering that simple 
      lines of code would change colors, layouts, or fonts to make a dull page interesting. 
      This quarter taught me not only technical skills but also the importance of 
      creativity and patience. I’m excited to use what I’ve learned in future
      projects and to keep improving my web design skills. </p>
