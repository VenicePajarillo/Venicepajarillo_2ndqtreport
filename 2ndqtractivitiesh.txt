<h2> Intramurals '24-'25 </h2> <br>

  <p> This year's intramurals weren't as fun as last year's, though I enjoyed a lot of the new activities <br>  that the MAPEH club offered. I also joined one sport, which was volleyball.

  <p> The process of creating our representative's costume was very enjoyable. <br>  I learned a lot about myself and discovered skills I didn’t know I had.  <br> Working on the dress     was fun, and  I improved many skills  <br>   that will be helpful later in life.   </p>

  <p> This event was so much fun! I assisted our representative along  with the other props team members, <br>  and the overall  experience was amazing.</p>
